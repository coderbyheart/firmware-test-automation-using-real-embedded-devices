## Agenda

- Project and testing goals
- Problems and solutions
- Learnings and outlook

## The project

In 2019, I joined a team working on
[open-source firmware sample](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/tree/v1.9.1/applications/asset_tracker_v2)
using two of our development kits for cellular IoT.

## üå©Ô∏è

I am responsible for demonstrating to our customers what they need on the cloud
side.

## System overview

![System overview](./system-overview.webp){width=30%}

## Needs

1. Ensure that cloud backend and firmware application work together.
2. Provide up-to date firmware for testing (endpoints need to be hardcoded) and
   releases  
   <small>2 hardware targets √ó 3 debug levels √ó 4 files =
   [24 artifacts / change](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-firmware-aws/releases/tag/v3.3.0)</small>

## QA resources closed-source

However, firmware build pipeline for our **open-source** sample applications is
**closed source**.

The tests are **closed source**, too.

## My Goals

Test firmware automatically for every change.

- because
  [**CONTINUOUS DELIVERY**](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/)!  
  (I want to go on vacation!).

- on GitHub Actions  
  (so customers can see, copy, adapt)

- More robust products = more $$$ (and we don't want our customers to end up on
  [@internetofshit](https://twitter.com/internetofshit)).

## Problems

Setting up system for building firmware is only documented as a manual process.

## Solution: Docker for dependencies

I've created a [Docker image](https://github.com/NordicPlayground/nrf-docker)
that provides all required dependencies.

- Nightly tests which build firmware
- Generalized for all firmware samples and applications in our SDK

## GitHub Actions &lt;3 Docker

GitHub Actions support Docker, so I can now
[build firmware from our SDK automatically](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-firmware-aws/blob/34d297f5fbfd43a1e6c55ab5e12d5ed7ee94655a/.github/workflows/build-and-release.yaml)!

</div>

## Warning: Docker is not deterministic!

If you are using this approach you must be aware that you are using software
from many untrusted sources with all the consequences that brings.

- Docker images are not deterministic. At build time, dependencies are fetched
  from third-party sources and installed. These dependencies could also contain
  malicious code.
- The entire image creation and publication is automated (build on GitHub
  Actions, and served by Dockerhub), which means there are multiple systems that
  can be compromised, during and after publication.
- Through automation we only ensure that the application can be build.

## More problems

Our SDK is a monorepo.

- The firmware application I am interested in is in a sub folder, but customers
  often use an _out-of-tree_ development model.
- Out-of-tree is recommended:  
  SDK as a dependency, not a fork.

## Solution: out-of-tree copy of subfolder

Use GitHub Actions to copy subfolder into
[seperate repository](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-firmware-aws/).

- Takes customers/users perspective.
- Pulls in SDK as a dependency.
- One repo per cloud-provider
  ([AWS](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-firmware-aws/),
  [Azure](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-firmware-azure/),
  ...)
  - cloud abstraction to support multiple cloud backends is not used by
    customers in practice.
- Introduces
  [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) on
  commit (not done in our SDK release process), because
  [**CONTINUOUS DELIVERY**](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/)!

## Even more problems

Can't use emulation (e.g. running in QEMU).

- removes entire network stack, so tests do not cover huge problem surface.

A lot of problems during testing are because of connection issues (TLS):

- certificates
- hostname(s)
- provisioning on the cloud side

## Solution: run on real hardware

![Test Setup](./test-setup.jpeg){width=50%}

## Workflow in GitHub Actions

1. Commit to repo triggers a GitHub Actions workflow
1. Compile firmware for test
1. Create credentials for device
1. Flash the firmware and credentials to the test board
1. Firmware boots, and (hopefully) connects to cloud
1. Test runner schedules FOTA
1. Test runner observes device activity (UART and in cloud) until success state
   reached, or timeout / error occurs

## Compile firmware for test

Runs on a GitHub runner, pulls Docker image and compiles the firmware. HEX file
is stored as artifact.  
<small>[Source](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-firmware-aws/blob/34d297f5fbfd43a1e6c55ab5e12d5ed7ee94655a/.github/workflows/build-and-release.yaml#L118)</small>

```bash
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/workdir/project nordicplayground/nrfconnect-sdk:main \
  /bin/bash -c '\
    cd firmware && \
    west init -l && \
    west update --narrow -o=--depth=1 && \
    west build -p always -b ${{ matrix.board }} -- \
      -DOVERLAY_CONFIG="overlay-aws.conf;overlay-pgps.conf;overlay-debug.conf;asset-tracker-cloud-firmware-aws.conf;firmware.conf" \
      -DEXTRA_CFLAGS="-Werror=format-truncation"\
    '
```

## Create credentials for device

Runner creates a certificate for a device with a unique and random name.

Repository has intermediate CA certificate, which can be used to create device
certificates.

Certificate is stored as artifact (so it can be accessed by other jobs later).

<small>[Source](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/asset-tracker-cloud-firmware-aws/blob/34d297f5fbfd43a1e6c55ab5e12d5ed7ee94655a/.github/workflows/build-and-release.yaml#L195-L210)</small>

## Flash the firmware and credentials to the test board

On a
[self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners),
with a development kit attached, the firmware and the certificates are flashed
onto the development kit.

- Started with RaspberryPI (ARM64 is supported by Segger)
- Now Ubuntu on an Intel NUC (faster to update, supported by our IT)

## Power cycle!

There are all kinds of reasons why devices crash, so turning it on and off again
is needed (power cycle).

## Test runner schedules FOTA

The test runner waits for the device to connect to the cloud (until it writes to
its shadow), then schedules a FOTA.

```
# Device has connected and reported device information.

# FOTA job "db572411-d7da-4c32-8f0c-5684e84c9242" created.

```

## Test runner observes device activity

Using UART we can immediately react on device output.

Nice, but:

- changes easily (spaces can break assertion)
- UART sometimes gets garbled (USB cables suck)

More hassle, than it's worth.  
Store output, but don't depend on it for testing.

Treat device as black box: observe outcome on cloud side.

## Test successfull!

We have now ensured, that

- the device can connect
- reports it's configuration to the cloud
- handles firmware-over-the-air updates

![BDD Tests](./bdd-tests.png)

## Should we test more?

We could do more, but:

- many things can be covered easier in unit tests
- from the cloud backend perspective connectivity + FOTA is **THE** critical
  feature

## Learnings

The toolchain for embedded devices (that I use) was not designed with automation
in mind.

It's hard to get it to work.

It is NOT [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/).

Uderstanding how everything plays together is a massive mindfuck.

But it IS possible!

## Outlook

I want to:

- remove test dependency on UART
- have multiple DKs per PC to test in parallel
- look into _commoditizing_ this approach

## Benefits

- end-to-end tests catch issues which are not found in unit testing
- I have discovered critical issues through this black-box testing
- also provides WORKING documentation and tracks changes of how to build our
  firmware applications

## Thank you & happy connecting!
